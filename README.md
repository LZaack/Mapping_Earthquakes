# Earthquakes Analysis

Basil and Sadhana asked me to created an earthquake map with two different maps and the earthquake overlay. In this new map, Basil and Sadhana want to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and they want to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map.

To make this posible, I added (i) Tectonic Plate Data; (ii) Major Earthquake Data; and (iii) Additional Map.
